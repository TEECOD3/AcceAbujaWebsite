            in our Culture. The ACCE&apos;s culture is built on its shared
            values and corporate philosophy. It&apos;s really the people that
            differentiate the Authority. We hire people who are disciplined,
            focused, smart and we favor ability over experience. Although our
            employees imbibe and embody the common goals and visions of the
            Authority, we hail from a broad and diverse background, reflecting
            the diversity and inclusiveness of our teams.

          <p>
            We maintain a professional culture often associated with top notch
            educational institutions and other affiliates, in which everyone is
            a pro-active contributor and feels comfortable sharing ideas and
            opinions
          </p>
          <p>
            We operate an open door policy while our work areas are designed to
            encourage interactions and exchange of ideas within and across
            teams. Our interactions are on a first name basis, nonetheless
            decorum and discretion is required.The ACCE tone is professional and
            succinct. The ACCE is an equal opportunities establishment. Our
            recruitment is driven strictly by needs matched with competency. We
            hire employees across functions based on best fit. In this way we
            are able to attract brilliant and committed minds whose natural
            culture fits into each role.
