I am tremendously proud to lead a dedicated and hardworking team. Our
priority is our pupils and our society. My team and I will strive to
provide the highest possible standard of education at all times for
your child, Insha Allah. We discovered a lack of understanding of
religion and its moral teachings in the Islamic youth today and we are
poised to solve this problem.

I am highly confident of the team we have on ground, their experience and dedication.
I ask Allah to be our support and to help us achieve far beyond what you will be expecting
as parents. At ACCE, we plan to equip our pupils with essential
knowledge and skills for living a pious life in a 21st century world.
Our energy is directed towards building in our pupils the confidence
to study, understand and apply any subject they have learnt in real
life situations, so that they graduate well-informed and can
successfully and confidently follow whatever career path they choose
in life.

We will equally equip pupils with the knowledge of Deen;
Quran memorization, Arabic, Adhkar, Tauheed, Fiqhu, Hadeeth, in a way
they will have a good understanding of and apply to their daily life.
Our main aim is to ensure that all our pupils study in a safe, secure
and happy environment at the school and graduate appreciating their
high level of achievement.

We are also proud of our curriculum; It is broad, balanced and
relevant to the needs of all our pupils. At the primary education
stage, we deliver a formal broad education system, focusing on
literacy and numeracy. We also introduce our pupils to a well-designed
and comprehensive curriculum of Islamic Religious Knowledge and
Information, Communication Technology (ICT)

In our secondary school, we have in addition to our curriculum, a
skills acquisition content. We believe the 21st century pupil deserves
an all round experience and learning should extend beyond the
classroom. These include the Al-Ansar Leadership Programme (ALP),
Young Journalists, Qur’an Memorisation Masters, Train the Trainers
Club (TTC), Young Farmers Club, STEM Club, Young Writers Club, The
Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme as well as numerous community based
projects. These programmes open our pupils’ minds to new experiences,
provide opportunities for them to work with professionals in their
various fields of expertise and to ultimately develop leadership
skills and qualities which are valued by universities, employers and
the society

We have zero tolerance for any form of mischief, such as exam
malpractice, drug abuse, bullying etc. Lastly, our carefully selected
team of Imams offer Islamic pastoral care to our pupils in order to
help strengthen their Imaan and knowledge of the Deen in line with the
teachings of the Qur’an and Sunnah. We look forward to receiving you
and your child in ACCE, Abuja
